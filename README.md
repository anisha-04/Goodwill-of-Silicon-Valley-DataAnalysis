This project delivers an in-depth, data-driven assessment of the financial health and performance of nonprofit Goodwill of Silicon Valley during a pivotal 2-year period.

With expertise in data visualization and financial analysis, I generated insightful graphs and charts using Python that spotlight year-over-year trends across critical metrics like:

Revenue growth and segmentation across core programs
Expense management across operations
Profitability indicators such as margin change
Liquidity ratios and reserves adequacy
Pension liabilities impact
Key discoveries from the analysis spotlight the organization's increasing reliance on retail revenues, concerning erosion in profit margins, and strong liquidity reserves growth.

The visualization library Matplotlib enabled impactful charts highlighting crucial changes in financial composition and trends. Presenting the financial data in graphical format supported identifying risks, opportunities, and priorities for leadership strategy decisions.

This project showcases methodologies for leveraging data visualization and exploratory analysis to transform complex nonprofit financial statements into actionable insights for executives. The techniques applied provide a framework for ongoing monitoring of organizational performance.
